## The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by,  tn = Â½n(n+1).

#### So, the sequence of triangle numbers goes like this: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120, 136, 153, 171, 190, 210, 231, 253, 276, 300, ...  By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

### Writie a Python program that asks the user for a word and checks, whether the entered word is a triangle word. Convert the entered word into CAPITAL cases, before  calculating  the  word  value.  If  the  entered  value  contains  any characters except A-Z and a-z print a corresponding error message.
